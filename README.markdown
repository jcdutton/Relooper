Relooper
========

This is an optimized C++ implemention of the Relooper algorithm originally
developed as part of Emscripten. This implementation includes optimizations
added since the original academic paper was published about it, and is
written in an LLVM-friendly way with the goal of inclusion in upstream
LLVM.
